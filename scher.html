<h2 id="pwork">Public Theater Poster Work</h2>
<p>
Paula Scher’s posters for The Public Theater in New York during the 1990s and 2000s completely changed how theater could be seen. She used bold typography, bright colors, and a sense of energy that made the posters feel alive and part of the city itself. They didn’t just advertise shows, they grabbed attention and drew people in, reflecting the chaos, excitement, and personality of urban life. That raw, expressive style is why people remember her posters and why they had such an impact.>
